# AI Cockpit Template

Universal session lifecycle primitives for Claude Code workspaces.

**Hop in. Fly. Land.**

## What This Is

A cockpit is a Claude Code workspace with a rhythm:

1. **`/takeoff`** — Boot sequence. Reads your last bookmark, checks what changed, shows priorities. Waits for orders.
2. **Work** — Use your domain-specific skills. The cockpit tracks state.
3. **`/land`** — Park sequence. Captures what got done, what's next, writes a bookmark for next session.

This template provides the universal primitives that every cockpit needs. Fork it, add your domain-specific skills, and you have a cockpit.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the template
gh repo create my-cockpit --template rhea-impact/ai-cockpit-template --public
cd my-cockpit

# Customize CLAUDE.md with your role context
# Add domain-specific skills to .claude/skills/

# Start working
claude
# > /takeoff
# > ... do your work ...
# > /land
```

## What's Included

### Skills (Universal Primitives)

| Skill | Trigger | What It Does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `/takeoff` | Start of session | ASCII header, drift detection, composes `/pre-flight` for full briefing |
| `/pre-flight` | Called by takeoff (or standalone) | Subagent scan: where we were / are / going / blockers |
| `/land` | End of session | Capture outcomes, blockers, next actions, write bookmark |
| `/cockpit-status` | Anytime | Show active workstreams, blockers, ages, who owes what |
| `/cockpit-repair` | When things break | Validate state files, find corruption, offer fixes |

### State Management

- **`state.json`** — Watermarks, counters, last-run timestamps. Skills read/write this to enable incremental operations.
- **Bookmarks** — Written to `~/.claude/bookmarks/` by `/land`. Read by `/takeoff` on next session. This is the bridge between sessions.

## Cockpit Architecture

```
your-cockpit/
├── .claude/
│   └── skills/
│       ├── takeoff/              # Boot sequence (from template)
│       ├── land/                 # Park sequence (from template)
│       ├── cockpit-status/       # Instrument panel (from template)
│       ├── pre-flight/            # Situational scan (from template)
│       ├── cockpit-repair/       # Diagnostics (from template)
│       └── your-domain-skill/    # Your additions
├── state.json                    # Session state & watermarks
├── CLAUDE.md                     # Role context + instructions
└── ...                           # Your domain-specific structure
```

## Design Principles

1. **Cheap boots** — `/takeoff` reads 2 things: state.json and latest bookmark. Git state and CLAUDE.md are already in session context. No redundant I/O.
2. **Session contracts** — Every session has a lifecycle: boot → work → land. Bookmarks are the contract between sessions.
3. **Drift detection** — If the branch changed, files were modified, or commits landed since your last bookmark, `/takeoff` tells you.
4. **Domain-agnostic** — The template knows nothing about your project. It only knows about sessions, bookmarks, and state.
5. **Composable** — Add as many domain skills as you want. The primitives stay the same.

## Keeping Cockpits in Sync

### For cockpit owners (pull updates into your cockpit)

```bash
cd your-cockpit
./bin/update-from-template              # pull latest skills from upstream
./bin/update-from-template --dry-run    # preview what would change
./bin/update-from-template --check      # just check if updates are available
```

This is the **recommended** approach. Each cockpit pulls from its upstream template. No central registry needed — the cockpit knows its template from `state.json`.

- Only updates template skills — never touches your domain-specific skills
- Detects local customizations via SHA256 hashing — won't clobber your changes
- Updates `skills_manifest.json` and `state.json` with the new version

Requires: `gh` (GitHub CLI) and `jq`.

### For template maintainers (push updates to known cockpits)

```bash
cd ai-cockpit-template
./bin/sync-skills              # push all skills to all registered cockpits
./bin/sync-skills land         # push just one skill
./bin/sync-skills --dry-run    # preview without changes
```

Reads `bin/cockpit-registry.txt` for local cockpit paths. Useful when you maintain multiple cockpits on one machine.

### Release workflow (for template maintainers)

```bash
# 1. Make your skill changes
# 2. Generate the manifest
./bin/generate-manifest v1.3.0

# 3. Commit and tag
git add skills_manifest.json
git commit -m "release: v1.3.0"
git tag v1.3.0
git push --tags

# 4. Downstream cockpits can now: ./bin/update-from-template
```
